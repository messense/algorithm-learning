# Algorithm Learning

This repo contains codes I wrote when I was learning algorithm. These codes are all written in C. And I compiled and tested them on OS X with clang/gcc.

## How to compile and test it

Firstly, clone it from Github:

    git clone git clone git://github.com/messense/algorithm-learning.git

Then compile it and you will find the executable programs in directory `bin`:

    cd algorithm-learning
    make

Now you can change directory to `bin` and run the programs to test it.
